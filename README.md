# Conway's Game of Life

Javascript version of Conway's Game of Life written by Bing Chat AI.  

This was an experiment to help learn how to use the AI to assist in writing code.  

This was created by Bing Chat AI using the following prompt:   

```
write an html page with embedded javascript that plays conway's game of life. the page should have a black background, the game board should be canvas with 1cm cells made of a grid of white lines. each cell should be a red circle that only appears when it is alive and should have no outline. the game board should be randomly populated with cells when it starts, and there should be a chance that a special game of life shape appears, like an oscilator or spaceship. the game should restart when it ends and loop forever. the canvas should fit to the screen.
make the circles for each cell gradiant colors
```

It was then modified by a human to make the randomized gradient for all cells static for each game because the original code would randomize all of the cells in the same game like confetti.
